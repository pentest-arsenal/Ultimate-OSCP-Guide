It can happen that during our penetration test, we come across outdated software and find an exploit that exploits an already known vulnerability. These exploits often contain intentional errors in the code. These errors often serve as a security measure because inexperienced beginners cannot directly execute these vulnerabilities to prevent harm to the individuals and organizations that may be affected by this vulnerability.

To edit and customize them, the most important thing is to understand how the vulnerability works, what function the vulnerability is in, and how to trigger execution. With almost all exploits, we will have to adapt the shellcode to our conditions. Instead, it depends on the complexity of the exploit.

It plays a significant role in whether the shellcode has been adapted to the protection mechanisms or not. In this case, our shellcode with a different length can have an unwanted effect. Such exploits can be written in different languages or only as a description.

The exploits may be different from the operating system, resulting in a different instruction, for example. It is essential to set up an identical system where we can try our exploit before running it blind on our target system. Such exploits can cause the system to crash, preventing us from further testing the service. Since it is part of our everyday life to continually find our way in new environments and always learn to keep the overview, we have to use new situations to improve and perfect this ability. Therefore we can use two applications to train these skills.
