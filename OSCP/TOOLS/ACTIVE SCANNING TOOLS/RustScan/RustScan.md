# 🤔 What is this?

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-what-is-this)

[![fast](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/raw/master/pictures/fast.gif "Speed")](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/pictures/fast.gif)

The Modern Port Scanner. **Find ports quickly (3 seconds at its fastest)**. Run scripts through our scripting engine (Python, Lua, Shell supported).

# ✨ Features

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-features)

- Scans all 65k ports in **3 seconds**.
- Full scripting engine support. Automatically pipe results into Nmap, or use our scripts (or write your own) to do whatever you want.
- Adaptive learning. RustScan improves the more you use it. No bloated machine learning here, just basic maths.
- The usuals you would expect. IPv6, CIDR, file input and more.
- Automatically pipes ports into Nmap.

# 🔭 Why RustScan?

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-why-rustscan)

RustScan is a modern take on the port scanner. Sleek & fast. All while providing extensive extendability to you.

Not to mention RustScan uses Adaptive Learning to improve itself over time, making it the best port scanner for **you**.

## 🧋 Speed

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-speed)

[![fast](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/raw/master/pictures/fast.gif "Speed")](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/pictures/fast.gif)

Speed is guaranteed via RustScan. However, if you want to run a slow scan due to stealth, that is possible too.

Firstly, let's talk code.

We have tests that check to see if RustScan is significantly slower than the previous version. If it is, the continuous integration fails, and we can't commit code to master unless we make it faster.

[HyperFine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine "Hyperfine") is used to monitor RustScan's performance over time to answer the question, "Are we getting faster? Are we getting slower?".

Every pull request is reviewed by **one** person, but more often than not, **two** people review it. We test it manually and ensure the code doesn't negatively affect performance.

[Read more here](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/Increasing-Speed-&-Accuracy "Increasing Speed & Accuracy").

## ⚙️ Extensible

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#%EF%B8%8F-extensible)

[![scripts](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/raw/master/pictures/scripts.gif "Scripts")](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/pictures/scripts.gif)

### _RustScan piping results into the custom Python script_

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#rustscan-piping-results-into-the-custom-python-script)

RustScan has a new scripting engine that allows anyone to write scripts in most languages. Python, Lua, and Shell are all supported.

Want to take your found ports and pipe them into Nmap for further analysis? That's possible. Want to run `smb-enum` if SMB is found open? Possible.

The possibilities are endless -- and you can write scripts in whatever language you feel comfortable with.

[Read more here](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/RustScan-Scripting-Engine "Scripting Engine").

## 🌊 Adaptive

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-adaptive)

[![adaptive](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/raw/master/pictures/adaptive.gif "Adaptive")](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/pictures/adaptive.gif)

### _RustScan automatically fine-tunes itself to match the host OS_

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#rustscan-automatically-fine-tunes-itself-to-match-the-host-os)

RustScan has a cool set of features called "Adaptive Learning". These features "learn" about the environment you are scanning and how _you_ use RustScan to **improve itself over time**.

We use this umbrella term for any feature that fits this criterion. The list constantly changes, so [check out our wiki for more information](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/Adaptive-Learning "Adaptive Learning").

## 👩‍🦯 Accessible

[](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan#-accessible)

[![fast](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/raw/master/pictures/accessible.gif "Fast")](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/pictures/accessible.gif)

RustScan is one of the first penetration testing tools that aims to be entirely accessible.

[Most penetration testing tools are not accessible](https://bees.substack.com/p/making-hacking-accessible "Making Hacking Accessible"), which negatively affects the whole industry.

RustScan has continuous integration testing that aims to ensure it is accessible, and we are constantly working on ways to improve our accessibility and ensure _everyone_ can use RustScan.

RustScan is a robust and versatile port scanning tool developed using the Rust programming language. It is specifically designed to meet the needs of network administrators, penetration testers, and security researchers who require a fast and comprehensive scanning solution. By utilizing asynchronous I/O and multi-threading, RustScan delivers impressive scanning speed and efficiency.

One of the key strengths of RustScan lies in its port scanning capabilities. It allows users to scan a range of IP addresses to identify open ports on target systems. Whether it’s a single host or a large network, RustScan handles the scanning process effectively. It supports both TCP and UDP protocols, enabling users to perform thorough scans and discover services running on open ports. The tool’s emphasis on speed and efficiency is evident in its implementation. RustScan employs parallel scanning techniques, leveraging multiple CPU cores to scan ports swiftly. This optimization ensures that scan times are minimized while efficiently utilizing system resources. The tool’s performance is especially beneficial when dealing with large-scale scanning scenarios.

RustScan offers comprehensive scan options and configurations to cater to diverse scanning requirements. Users have the flexibility to specify target IP addresses, port ranges, and protocols for scanning. Additionally, it allows customization of timeout values, rate limits, and parallelization settings, enabling fine-tuning of the scanning process to suit specific needs.

Another notable feature of RustScan is its service detection capability. In addition to identifying open ports, it gathers information about the services running on those ports. Through banner grabbing techniques, RustScan extracts details such as version numbers and software identification. This service detection feature proves valuable for vulnerability assessment, security auditing, and understanding the target system’s software stack.

RustScan provides flexible output options to accommodate different use cases. Users can generate scan results in plain text, JSON, or XML formats, allowing for easy integration with other tools and further analysis of the obtained data. The ability to obtain machine-readable output enhances the tool’s utility and compatibility with various workflows.

Moreover, RustScan is designed to be extensible, allowing users to enhance its functionality through plugin modules. The plugin system enables the integration of additional scanning techniques, data analysis, or collaboration with other security tools. This extensibility empowers users to tailor RustScan to their specific scanning requirements and leverage its capabilities to the fullest. As an open-source project, RustScan benefits from a vibrant community of developers and users. The project’s source code is publicly available, encouraging transparency, collaboration, and contributions from the community. This active community ensures continuous development, bug fixes, and improvements to the tool, making RustScan a reliable and evolving solution.

# Task 2: Installing RustScan

The installation procedure of RustScan is very easy.

**Note:** If you use Mac OS, Arch, Docker, Nix OS or any other operating system than Debian more install instructions can be found on the repository.

[https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/Installation-Guide](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/Installation-Guide)

Go to [RustScan Repo](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/releases).

Download the **.deb file** for Kali Linux.[(rustscan_1.8.0_amd64.deb**)**](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/releases/download/1.8.0/rustscan_1.8.0_amd64.deb)

In terminal type:- **dpkg -i <file name>**

Try running **rustscan** in terminal.

# Task 3: Accessible

RustScan is actively accessible. That means we:

- Use continuous integration testing to ensure accessibility needs are met
- Manually test accessibility

This is important because accessibility is important in hacking.

Hacking isn’t just inaccessible, it is the opposite — it is actively discluding members from the community because of some issues they were born or developed that they cannot help.

It is a basic human right to extend everything we do to be accessible to everyone. In the same way, it is right for you to get healthcare, to get an education.

Around 15% of all people suffer from some sort of disability. See this blog post for [more info](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/why-i-care-about-accessibility/) on why accessibility is important or the [world report on disability for statistics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_report_on_disability)

For more information about accessibility in infosec, [I wrote this blog post](https://bees.substack.com/p/making-hacking-accessible).

Click “completed” if you agree A11Y in infosec is important

# Task 4: Fast

RustScan is fast. But, why? In short:

- Low-level kernel networking
- Written in a fast language (Rust)
- Asynchronous scanning. Multi-threading is slow due to the context switching cost. Async is fast. [See my Rust room for more information on this](https://tryhackme.com/room/rust).

At its fastest settings, the bottleneck is not the program. The bottleneck is your computer, the network link between your computer and the target, and finally the target itself.

If your OS/hardware isn’t the best, that’ll be the bottleneck.

This sounds bad, but some other port scanners have their bottlenecks in the program itself. RustScan is as fast as your system, the network, and the target is.

Being so fast is bad, but RustScan can be slowed down to however slow you want. But just know, if speed is your thing — RustScan is where it’s at.

**How do you ensure speed?**

As more features are added into RustScan, slowness tends to creep in unless noticed.

As we add more features, the program generally tends to slow down. This is a rule for all programs. More complexity will often mean it is slower (but not always).

RustScan deals with this by:

- Manual testing on targets
- Continuous integration that fails if the program is too slow
- Benchmarking the program and graphing the results
- Keeping all features outside of the scanning itself. Unless it is absolutely needed, RustScan will not run code before or during the scan — only after.

# Task 5: Extensible

Now for the largest feature of RustScan. Thanks to Bergabman for working on this one.

RustScan is extensible by the RustScan Scripting Engine. This allows you to write a script which runs after the scan has completed, taking inputs of open ports and their respective IPs.

RSE supports these languages:

- Python
- Shell
- Perl
- Any program which is a binary and in $PATH

**Scripting Engine Arguments**

RustScan’s scripting engine can be altered using the “ — scripts” argument.

There are 3 possible arguments:

- None (don’t run any scripts)
- Custom (run all scripts in the scripts folder)
- Default (runs Nmap script, or whatever script is in the config file. Default does not need to be enabled, it is on by default.)

**Python Custom Scripts**

To execute a custom script, we need a `rustscan_scripts.toml` file located at `$HOME/.rustscan_scripts.toml`.

The script file should look like:

# Test/Example ScriptConfig file# Tags to filter on scripts. Only scripts containing all these tags will run.  
tags = ["core_approved", "example"]# If it's present then only those scripts will run which has a tag ports = "80". Not yet implemented.  
#  
# ex.:  
# ports = ["80"]  
# ports = ["80","81","8080"]  
ports = ["80"]# Only this developer(s) scripts to run. Not yet implemented.  
developer = ["example"]

Let’s walk through this.

Firstly, for reference, this is a basic Python script.

#!/usr/bin/python3  
#tags = ["core_approved", "example",]  
#developer = [ "example", "https://example.org" ]  
#trigger_port = "80"  
#call_format = "python3 {{script}} {{ip}} {{port}}"# Scriptfile parser stops at the first blank line with parsing.  
# This script will run itself as an argument with the system installed python interpreter, only scanning port 80.  
# Unused filed: ports_separator = ","import sysprint('Python script ran with arguments', str(sys.argv))

Note: the metadata of scripts is stored as comments. The first line is always a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)).

# Tags

Tags are categories of scripts. For example, we may have these categories:

- HTTP
- SSH
- Tomcat

And only wish to run scripts that match these categories. Our config file will only execute the scripts with matching categories.

# Developer

This tag issues who the developer of the script is.

# Trigger Point

This tag states at what port should the script trigger? For HTTP it would be “80”. For HTTP and HTTPS it would be “80, 443”

# Call Format

RustScan uses a templating library called [text_placeholder](https://crates.io/crates/text_placeholder).

This allows us to enclose variables in `{{variable}}` doubly curly braces. RustScan supports 3 variables:

- The script name
- The IP address
- The port(s)

#call_format = "python3 {{script}} {{ip}} {{port}}"

# The Code itself

Now everything after this metadata is the code itself.

The script will receive arguments via `sys.argv` in the format specified in the `call_format` variable.

Now with this data, we run the script, doing whatever we please!

# Contributing / Making Scripts

We have a folder of example scripts [here](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/tree/master/fixtures/.rustscan_scripts).

If you make a script, please consider contributing to RustScan. Right now you can submit a pull request to [this folder](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/tree/master/fixtures/.rustscan_scripts) and we’ll include your script.

# Running Other Tools with RustScan

Any tool installed in the system (like Nmap, GoBuster, etc) can be run with RustScan.

We do this by default with Nmap.

To execute another program, create a shell script which calls that program. So to call Nmap, create a shell script with our RustScan Scripting Engine and then for the function:

nmap -vvv -p {{port}} {{ip}}

You can replace this with GoBuster or any program at all. So long as the program is installed and reachable in the environment $PATH.

**Q.1:** What is the scripting file config called?

> **_Answer: rustscan_scripts.toml_**

**Q.2:** Can you run other binaries with RustScan? (T)rue / (F)alse.

> **_Answer: T_**

**Q.3:** Does RustScan support scripts in Javascript? (T)rue / (F)alse.

> **_Answer: F_**

# Task 6: Adaptive

RustScan is **adaptive**. That means it changes how it works to better suit its environment. We call this the “adaptive learning” feature set.

Some of these features included (or are being worked on) are:

- Adaptive Outbound SYN timing to optimize the speed of scanning

While RustScan scans the target, it learns how it reacts, How fast is it to scan? Does it respond quickly? How far away?

By using this data RustScan moulds itself so it is the fastest scanner for any target.

- Custom Top Ports

You may be familiar with the top ports feature of other scanners. It’ll let you scan the top 1000 ports on the internet.

But, the top 1000 ports on the internet are not often the top 1000 ports you might come across. Corporate networks may have unusual ports open, capture the flag events may have unusual ports. As an example, port 31137 is used a lot in CTFs because “l33t”.

This port is not in any top 1000 ports list.

RustScan learns what the most commonly open ports are **for you** and adapts itself.

- Operating System Adaption

Your computer is not the same as my computer. So why run the same scan settings? Mac OS devices have an open file limit of around 250. That means they can only make 250 connections at any given time.

Kali Linux has around 90,000 open files.

If we built this for Kali Linux, it would break on a Mac which does not support that many open files.

RustScan learns about your operating system and adapts itself to better suit you and your computer, as well as the networks it is scanning.

- Configuration File

All of this information is stored in a configuration file. Onboarding a new pentesting intern? Send them your config file and their RustScan will be optimal from day 1.

# Task 7: Scanning Time!

The tool is really amazing in terms of scanning. It can scan all the ports really fast and then pipe the output to the Nmap. Now in this room, we’ll scan our vulnerable machine.  
Basic format for RustScan is **rustscan -r ports -a <Target-ip> — <nmap**

**cmds>**

Here’s a full list of things you can do.

# Multiple IP Scanning

You can scan multiple IPs using a comma-separated list like so:

rustscan -a 127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0

# Host Scanning

RustScan can also scan hosts, like so:

➜ rustscan -a www.google.com, 127.0.0.1  
Open 216.58.210.36:1  
Open 216.58.210.36:80  
Open 216.58.210.36:443  
Open 127.0.0.1:53  
Open 127.0.0.1:631

# CIDR support

RustScan supports CIDR:

➜ rustscan -a 192.168.0.0/30

# Hosts file as input

The file is a new line separated list of IPs / Hosts to scan:

hosts.txt

192.168.0.1  
192.168.0.2  
google.com  
192.168.0.0/30  
127.0.0.1

The argument is:

rustscan -a 'hosts.txt'

# Individual Port Scanning

RustScan can scan individual ports, like so:

➜ rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -p 53  
53

# Multiple selected port scanning

You can input a comma-separated list of ports to scan:

➜ rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -p 53,80,121,65535  
53

# Ranges of ports

To scan a range of ports:

To run:

➜ rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 --range 1-1000      
53,631

# Adjusting the Nmap arguments

RustScan, at the moment, runs Nmap by default.

You can adjust the arguments like so:

rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -- -A -sC

To run:

nmap -Pn -vvv -p $PORTS -A -sC 127.0.0.1

# Random Port Ordering

If you want to scan ports in a random order (which will help with not setting off firewalls) run RustScan like this:

➜ rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 --range 1-1000 --scan-order "Random"  
53,631

**Q.1:** After scanning this, how many ports do we find open under 1000?
