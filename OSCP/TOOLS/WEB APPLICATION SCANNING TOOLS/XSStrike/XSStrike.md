XSStrike is a Cross Site Scripting detection suite equipped with four hand written parsers, an intelligent payload generator, a powerful fuzzing engine and an incredibly fast crawler.

Instead of injecting payloads and checking it works like all the other tools do, XSStrike analyses the response with multiple parsers and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis integrated with a fuzzing engine. Here are some examples of the payloads generated by XSStrike:

```
}]};(confirm)()//\
<A%0aONMouseOvER%0d=%0d[8].find(confirm)>z
</tiTlE/><a%0donpOintErentER%0d=%0d(prompt)``>z
</SCRiPT/><DETAILs/+/onpoINTERenTEr%0a=%0aa=prompt,a()//
```

Apart from that, XSStrike has crawling, fuzzing, parameter discovery, WAF detection capabilities as well. It also scans for DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

# XSStrike — A tool to detect XSS

# Introduction:

Hai Friends, I hope you’re doing well. In this blog, I will discuss the XSStrike Tool, an automated tool designed to identify XSS vulnerabilities.

# 1. What is XSS?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts are typically executed in the context of the user’s browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate website content, or perform other malicious actions.

The most common form of XSS involves inserting malicious code, such as JavaScript, into input fields or URLs of a website. When another user visits the affected page and interacts with the compromised element, the malicious script gets executed, leading to potential harm.

**XSS**

The most common form of XSS involves inserting malicious code, such as JavaScript, into input fields or URLs of a website. When another user visits the affected page and interacts with the compromised element, the malicious script gets executed, leading to potential harm.

XSS attacks can be classified into three main types:

**Stored XSS:** The injected script is permanently stored on the target server, affecting anyone who accesses the particular page or content.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:681/1*iS4sjtqPgAjvjueIM0ZefQ.png)

**Stored XSS**

**Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected off a web server, usually as part of a crafted URL. When a user clicks on the malicious link, the script is executed in their browser.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*okBWXRphwrpIwzi6oSHWlw.png)

**Reflected XSS**

**DOM-based XSS:** This type of XSS occurs entirely on the client side. The malicious script manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, leading to unintended behaviour.

# 2. Impact of XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a critical security issue that can have significant consequences for websites and their users. To understand its impact, consider a scenario where an online shopping website allows users to leave product reviews, and these reviews are displayed to other users. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the review submission process and injects a malicious script into their review. When other users visit the product page and read the tainted review, the malicious script executes in their browsers without their knowledge. This could lead to various harmful outcomes. For instance, the script might steal users’ login credentials, credit card information, or other sensitive data, leaving them vulnerable to identity theft or financial fraud. Additionally, the attacker could tamper with the website’s content, replacing legitimate links with phishing URLs to trick users into disclosing their personal information unwittingly. As a result of these attacks, the website’s reputation may suffer, leading to a loss of trust among its users and potential legal consequences. To mitigate XSS risks, web developers must carefully validate and sanitize user inputs, while users should remain cautious when interacting with unfamiliar or suspicious content on websites to protect themselves from falling victim to such attacks.

# 3. Methods to find XSS Vulnerability

To find Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, follow these steps. First manually looking for XSS vulnerabilities, security experts begin by examining the website’s source code, including the frontend and backend parts. They carefully check input fields, URL parameters, and cookie handling to find possible points where harmful scripts could be inserted. To confirm these vulnerabilities, they create various XSS payloads and inject them into the website’s URL and input fields, observing how the application reacts. This testing helps find areas where user inputs are not properly validated or sanitized, making it possible for attackers to insert dangerous scripts.

After the manual assessment, they use specialized XSS scanners for automated testing. These tools are designed to systematically search for known XSS attack vectors all over the website. They scan different inputs, forms, and URL parameters extensively to detect potential vulnerabilities. The scanners can quickly cover a large part of the website and find issues that might have been missed during manual testing.

By combining manual and automated testing, security experts can get a more thorough evaluation of XSS vulnerabilities. This combined method makes XSS vulnerability detection more effective, helping website owners secure their applications and protect users from possible malicious attacks.

# 4. XSStrike

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:480/1*73-E4Ha0o9q-oDRpPXTLIw.png)

**XSStrike**

**Description:**

XSStrike is a tool designed to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It has four parsers and an intelligent payload generator, making it different from other tools. Instead of blindly injecting payloads and checking if they work, XSStrike analyzes the website’s response using various parsers. Based on this analysis and with the help of a fuzzing engine, it crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work in different contexts. In simple terms, XSStrike carefully examines how the website responds to different inputs and then generates specific payloads that are more likely to exploit the vulnerabilities found. This approach increases the chances of successful XSS detection.

**Features and advantages of XSStrike**

XSStrike is a feature-rich tool designed for detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Its capabilities include both Reflected and DOM XSS scanning, enabling the identification of various XSS issues. With multi-threaded crawling, XSStrike efficiently explores websites, making it a time-efficient option for security assessments. The tool’s unique context analysis empowers an intelligent payload generator, crafting payloads that are guaranteed to be effective in exploiting vulnerabilities. Its highly configurable core allows users to customize the tool to suit specific testing requirements. Additionally, XSStrike excels in WAF detection and evasion, providing enhanced resilience in security assessments. The tool’s comprehensive approach includes scanning for outdated JavaScript libraries and ensuring thorough security checks. Its handmade HTML and JavaScript parsers deliver precise and reliable results. The powerful fuzzing engine aids in systematic vulnerability testing. Furthermore, XSStrike supports Blind XSS, offering the capability to uncover concealed security weaknesses. The tool follows a well-structured workflow based on thorough research, ensuring a systematic approach to vulnerability detection. Complete HTTP support allows for comprehensive website examination, and the option to brute force payloads from a file and perform payload encoding adds versatility to the testing process.

## Understanding XSS Vulnerabilities

### Types of XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can be classified into three types:

- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, and executed when a user accesses the affected content.
- **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts are reflected off a web application onto the user’s browser, typically through a URL parameter.
- **DOM-based XSS:** The attack is executed within the Document Object Model (DOM) of the browser, altering the client-side code.

### How XSS Exploits Work

XSS exploits involve injecting malicious code into web applications. When users interact with the compromised application, their browsers execute the malicious script, leading to unauthorized actions like data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

### Real-World Examples of XSS Attacks

Notable XSS attacks include the Samy worm on MySpace, which propagated by exploiting a Stored XSS vulnerability, and the Reflected XSS attack on Twitter, which allowed attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in users’ browsers. These examples underscore the critical need for effective XSS mitigation strategies.

### The Impact of XSS Vulnerabilities

The impact of XSS vulnerabilities can be devastating. They can compromise user data, damage a company’s reputation, and result in legal and financial penalties. Understanding their impact emphasises the importance of rigorous security testing and proactive vulnerability management.
