**This Obsidian Ultimate OSCP Guide is meant to be your go-to reference during the OSCP exam. It's loaded with all the info you need, and once you bring it into your own Obsidian setup, you can use the find function to tap into a massive database of OSCP-specific knowledge. No more juggling 10+ open tabs on Brave/Chrome/Firefoxâ€”everything you need is right here. The goal of this project is for anyone with a decent amount of technical knowledge to be able to grab this guide/template and begin their exam in less than a week. Feel free to fork this repo and build on it to make it your own.**
