**This Obsidian Ultimate OSCP Guide is meant to be your go-to reference during the OSCP exam. It's loaded with all the info you need, and once you bring it into your own Obsidian setup, you can use the find function to tap into a massive database of OSCP-specific knowledge. No more juggling 10+ open tabs on Brave/Chrome/Firefoxâ€”everything you need is right here.**

**This project has two primary goals: First, to enable anyone with a solid technical foundation to grab this guide/template and be fully prepared to begin their exam in less than a week. Second, to ensure that only the tools permitted within the OSCP exam guidelines are included, strictly avoiding those that could be considered automated exploitation or cross the boundaries of what is allowed.**

**Feel free to fork this repo and build on it to make it your own.**
